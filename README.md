# TwitterScrape
Scrapes Twitter for tweet posts by search query Using Selenium. This repository is not convenient to repurpose, so it may require some patience.

# REQUIREMENTS
If you wish to repurpose and use, you will need to go through the code and fill the places I commented, i.e. line 21 of twitterbot.py needs to be replaced with the URL you wish to scrape and credentials.txt will need to be have your bot details. 
Also, you must install and add chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 
The code will not work without these adjustments.

# Notes
time.sleep should be adjusted based on your internet speeds and willingness to risk Twitter security. 
This project was designed in windows. Modifications may need to be made for Linux and others. 
Desiredtweets is the approximate number of tweets and may not be exact. 
The project will prompt you in a print to the console for a username
