# TwitterScrape
Scrapes Twitter Using Selenium. In this case I created this for the purpose of scraping posts concerning the Just Stop Oil protests

REQUIREMENTS
If you wish to repurpose and use, you will need to go through the code and fill the places I commented, i.e. line 21 of twitterbot.py needs to be replaced with the URL you wish to scrape and credentials.txt will need to be have your bot details.
Also, you must install and add chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
The code will not work without these adjustments.

time.sleep should be adjusted based on your internet speeds and willingness to risk Twitter security

This project was designed in windows. Modifications may need to be made for Linux and others.
