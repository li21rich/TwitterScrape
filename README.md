# TwitterScrape
Scrapes Twitter Using Selenium. In this case I created this for the purpose of scraping posts concerning the Just Stop Oil protests

If you wish to repurpose, you will need to install the imported items in the code using pip. Also, you will need to go through the code and resolve the commented places that need to be replaced, i.e. line 21 of twitterbot.py needs to be replaced with the URL you wish to scrape.
